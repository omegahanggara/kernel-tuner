You may wonder, what's the difference between not-optimized paramater, and optimized parameter.
BEFORE you try this kernel tuner, visit http://speedtest.net to check your current internet speed!
After you got some information from your test, then launch this script.
Check again your internet speed (now you are optimized) on http://speedtest.net
See the difference? Feel the speed!
